## Goal
Eventually I plan for this to be a web-based diff checker between Valve Map Format files with advanced statistics and comparison tools. Currently has support for job queuing.
Requires PHP 8+ and a MySQL database.  

## TODO
- Fix the parser, because it's pretty cooked right now.
- Design a better UI.
- Expand the analysis and statistics to all possible KeyValues you can generate within Hammer++
- Security
